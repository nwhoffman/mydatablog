I like science and data and combining them in different ways to make cool data science projects. Using my background in geophysics, I like to make interesting visualizations of earth science data, which so far, have been mostly about earthquakes.

I welcome any feedback on my code and analyses. If you have interesting data set ideas, please share! My favourite topics are geophysics, Star Trek, and cats. And aliens.

I am currently employed in teaching my three children at home. We watch a lot of Star Trek, talk about earthquakes, and make stuff. Which mostly seems to be food.
